            <h3>Hello! I'm Ed. I'm a high school junior living in New York with an interest in computer software,
                particularly web. I also like other things like taking pictures, listening to music, and playing the
                cello.</h3>

            <h1>What's your story?</h1>
            <h3>I've had an interest in programming ever since I was 8. I started by learning basic concepts in
                languages such as Scratch and Basic. Later on I taught myself Java, Python, and GameMaker. Today, I have
                a part-time job teaching kids how to code at <a href='https://kidoyo.com' target='_blank'>KidOYO</a>. If
                you are interested in my projects, take a look on my <a href='https://github.com/edwardscamera'
