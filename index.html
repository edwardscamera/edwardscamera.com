            <h3>I've had an interest in programming ever since I was 8. I started by learning basic concepts in languages such as Scratch and Basic. Later on I taught myself Java, Python, and GameMaker. Today, I have a part-time job teaching kids how to code at <a href='https://kidoyo.com' target='_blank'>KidOYO</a>.
